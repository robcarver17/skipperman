The first grey nav allows you to get help, go back to the main menu or [add a new event](add_event_help.md). 
The second nav bar allows you to sort the list of events in different ways. This is followed by buttons for each event. Pressing an individual event button will allow you to [manage](view_event_help.md) a specific event.
