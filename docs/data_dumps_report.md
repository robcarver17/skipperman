A data dump is just a raw spreadsheet full of data, rather than a neat report. It can be useful for doing certain kinds of analysis of the Skipperman data.

# Volunteer data dump

This dump contains:
- The volunteers name
- Cadets they are connected to
- Skills they have
- The previous events they were volunteers at, and in which role

By filtering on skills, you can check to see who is currently qualified to instruct, and who for example is missing their first aid. You should do this after [refreshing the qualification data](refresh_skills_with_import_help.md).

Seeing previous roles can also be useful for pre season planning.
