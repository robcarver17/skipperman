For a given volunteer we can see:

- the events they have helped at in the past, and in which role
- The skills they have, or are missing
- Their connections to sailors. A connection is a close relative eg child or grandchild. This is used to avoid putting volunteers together with their children during training weekends to reduce the risk of 'helicopter parenting'.

We can edit their names and skills or their connections to sailors.

# Edit names and skills

Edit the volunteers name; this should only be required if they now wish to be known differently (and you should edit their name rather than create a new volunteer). You can also select from the skills they could hold. If you aren't sure if their skills are currently valid or correct, there is a link to the spreadsheet used by the sailing school manager. This is currently the true source of skills information - not Skipperman. There is no automatic way to update skills in Skipperman unfortunately.

# Edit connections to sailors

A list of connected sailors is shown. Click on the appropriate button to delete a connection, or choose sailors to connect to the volunteer. Sailors with similar surnames are shown first in the list; other sailors are shown in alphabetical order.

Note that connections are also created when sailors are registered for training events. Sometimes this connection doesn't make sense, for example if another adult is looking after a cadet just for that one event. You can remove those connections here.
