To run a volunteer rota report, from the **main menu** select **Reports**, and **Volunteer rota for event**. Then choose your event.
___

A volunteer rota report shows where volunteers are working. A good workflow is to publish this report about a week before the event (further in advance before Cadet Week).

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.

There is also a power boats only report. This is a good report to download as a spreadsheet, to give to the senior instructor and safety lead for the event.

# Report specific parameters

The options in the report are:

- The days in the event to include in the report file. Default is to select all (which you can do by selecting the final checkbox). You may want to deslect, eg if there is nobody rota'd for the first day of Cadet Week.
- Report for power boats only. If you select this, you will only see power boats, and the grouping in the report will be between lake and river boats.

Click back if you don't want to change parameters, and reset if you want to [return them to their default values](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#resetting-options).

Once you have selected the specific parameters you want, click save to return to the main [reporting option page](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#the-reporting-option-page), or [create a report with these options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#creating-a-report).

# Recommended printing options

It's recommended you use the following [printing options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#print-options):

For the normal report:

- output to pdf
- output to public
- A3 landscape (since the report will probably be printed in A3, but landscape is better for busy reports)
- highlight first name in group - yes (this is the team leader)
- put group name in header - yes
- do not include group size or prepend group name

See [making reports look good](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#making-the-pdf-report-look-nice) for advice on setting group arrangements and other print options.

For the power boats only report (these are not the defaults):

- output to csv
- output to public (optionally if you want to share with everyone on safety boat duty)

# Configuring the teams

If you want to change the volunteer teams, this can be done through the [configuration pages](configuration_help.md#volunteer-teams).

# Sharing the report

The report can be publicly accessed once created from the web link shown on the [main reporting options page](#the-reporting-option-page). The web link will always end with the filename you are using.

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.

Report links can also be shared via QR codes, which can be created by clicking the 'Get QR code for report' button under 'Modify printing options', if a report is public.

You can also delete your report after the event from the [utilities / file management page](file_management_help.md).
