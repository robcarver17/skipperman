This will delete all [attendance data](mark_attendance_help.md) for a given event. It's most useful for Cadet Week, where we take roll call on the registration day, but this doesn't form a part of the event on Skipperman. Hence after the first day is over, and once all cadets are back with parents, run this process to allow registration to be repeated the following day.
