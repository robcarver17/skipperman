The volunteer rota page is used to allocate volunteers to jobs. Only volunteers who have been added to the event can be allocated. Volunteers are normally added when an event is [imported](event-import#Volunteer import), but you can also manually add them here. You can also allocate volunteers in patrol boat mode: this makes most sense for rescue boat drivers. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

### Quick start

After an event has been imported, you will be presented with a screen like this:

[!Volunteer rota screen](/static/volunteer_rota_overview.png)

Each row shows a volunteer who has been imported to the event automatically.
