Data can be backed up in two different ways on Skipperman.

- A data snapshot
- A full backup

# Data snapshot

Snapshots are stored locally on the Skipperman server, and are a good way to periodically save what you have done in case you do something stupid (since there is no undo function). To make a snapshot you can eithier click 'Snapshot data' on the main menu page, or click the 'Write a snapshot of the data now' button on the backup data utilities menu option. To restore a snapshot, click on the 'Restore data from data snapshot' button on the backup data menu. 

Once a snapshot has been restored you can't go back to how the data was before the snapshot was taken (unless you already have a snapshot or full ), so please bear this in mind.

Only the last 10 snapshots are kept.

# Full backup

A full backup creates a .zip file containing all the data which is then downloaded to your local machine. This
