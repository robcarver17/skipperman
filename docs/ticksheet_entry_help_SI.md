The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress, and to award qualifications. 
To access it, from the **main menu** choose **Instructors**, then the event, then choose the group, and finally the qualification.

On entering the area you will see something like this:

# Printing ticksheets

You may want to print the ticksheet to excel (this actually downloads it, and there you can print it). You will probably want to tidy up the formatting a bit, possibly abbreviate medical notes, or import into your own format. Note: The * against a cadets name in a printed ticksheet means they have booked a club boat. Note: Health information is confidential and should only be retained for as long as required. Paper ticksheets must be returned to the cadet skipper or destroyed. Downloaded files should be deleted after the event.

# Entering ticks and awarding qualifications

There are two edit modes, ‘checkbox’ and ‘dropdown’. In checkbox mode you can only award full or no ticks. In dropdown mode you specify tick values using a dropdown menu; this allows you to aware Not Applicable (NA) or half ticks as well as the binary choice of full tick or no tick. A half-tick means you have introduced a given topic, but the cadet has not yet demonstrated it.

## Checkbox tick entry

In checkbox mode you can only award full ticks, or reset an item to no ticks. You can also give a cadet all their ticks by clicking on the full tick button under their name ('row apply'), or give all your cadets a tick for a specific item by clicking on the relevant item ('column apply'). If nearly all your cadets got a specific item, then it’s quicker to award it to all of them and then remove it from the cadet who missed out.

Note that if a half tick or N/A tick is awarded, then this can’t be edited to a full or no tick in checkbox mode - as is the case for David and ropework. You will need to go to dropdown mode. 

Clicking on a cadet name will award the RYA qualification for the relevant cadet, or remove the qualification (which clearly should only be done if there was an error and you clicked the wrong button). 

When you are done just save your changes (pressing a button to award/remove qualifications, or award all ticks to a cadet or to all cadets for a specific item will also save changes). If you don’t want to save, press cancel and that will abandon everything you have done since you last pressed a button (row or column apply, save button or award/withdraw qualification).


## Dropdown tick entry

In dropdown mode you specify tick values using a dropdown menu; this allows you to award Not Applicable (NA) or half ticks as well as the binary choice of full tick or no tick. Clicking on the buttons below a cadet name or item will award that tick level for all items for a given cadet ('row apply'), or set all ticks to that level for that item over all cadets ('column apply').

Clicking on a cadet name will award the RYA qualification for the relevant cadet, or remove the qualification (which clearly should only be done if there was an error and you clicked the wrong button). 

When you are done just save your changes (pressing a button to award all ticks to a cadet or to all cadets for a specific item will also save changes). If you don’t want to save, press cancel and that will abandon everything you have done since you last pressed a button (row or column apply, save button or award/withdraw qualification).

# Qualification awards

Important notes:
- The current name of the volunteer logged in to Skipperman is logged with the date against the qualification.  
- You don’t need all the ticks selected to award a qualification. All the ticks will automatically be selected for you when you click the award button.
- Qualifications that have already been awarded should not be withdrawn because you disagree with a previous decision - only in case of accident
- If you withdraw a qualification from a cadet, it won't affect their ticks.
- This means if you accidentally award a qualification to a cadet without all their ticks, and then withdraw it, you will see the missing ticks again once you have withdrawn the award.

# Skipperman on mobile - individual cadet editing

It’s quite hard to see a big ticksheet on a phone. This isn’t so bad if you are just applying ticks to all cadets at the same time, since you can scroll left and right across the column heading buttons that do this. But it’s hard to know when you are looking at a cadet who is halfway down a big list which ticks you are settting. So there is the facility to select a single cadet. You can’t do this whilst you are editing, only before you start. Let’s say I only want to do the ticks for David. I click on his name:

![ticksheet_entry4.png](/static/ticksheet_entry4.png)

All the other cadets have gone. I can now proceed with editing in the normal way, for example by clicking on `Edit using checkboxes`:

![ticksheet_entry_SI3.png](/static/ticksheet_entry_SI3.png)

I can easily scroll left and right to see and edit all of his ticks. Notice that the buttons at the top of the column that apply ticks to all cadets are now gone – with only one cadet these aren’t needed. 

Once done, I click on save, and I am back to viewing just one cadet. And if I am done with David I can now click on `Show all cadets` to see everyone again. And I can then select a new cadet to edit.
