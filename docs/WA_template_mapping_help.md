Template mapping is useful for *advanced* users of Skipperman to create custom field mapping files. [More help on field mapping](WA_field_mapping_help.md).

**Warning: if you select a template it will delete any existing field mapping. There will be no warning or confirmation!! Click Cancel if you are unusure.**

- A new skipper will often come up with a set of standard registration forms for each type of event they are running. As these are new forms, they can't be [cloned](WA_clone_mapping_help.md) from previous events. 
- At the start of their tenure, they can set up a series of template mappings, one for each event type.
- Each of these templates can then be selected when a new event is added.
- A template can also be a starting point to customise the mapping for a given event.
- Once an event of a given type has been run, you could also use cloning to copy the mapping for a previous event.

# Upload a new template

A mapping template file is just a .csv file with a list of the mappings. To create your own, from scratch or by editing an existing template or event, see [creating your own mapping](WA_create_your_own_mapping_help.md).

Click on 'upload a new template', and then in the input box type the template name, click on choose file, select the file, then upload the selected file.

If you type the name of an existing template, that will be overwritten.

It's useful to give templates a year suffix, but not to specify a specific event (so use 'Training weekend 2025' rather than 'June training 2025'). The obvious exception is Cadet Week.


# Using an existing template

Once you have the template(s) you want to use set up, from the template menu select a template to use. **Warning: if you select a template it will delete any existing field mapping. There will be no warning or confirmation!!**
