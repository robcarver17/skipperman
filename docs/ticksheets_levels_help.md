The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

On entering the ticksheet area for a given group you will see a screen like this:

Click on a qualification if you want to view, edit or print ticksheets for cadets in your group.
