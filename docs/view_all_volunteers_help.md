The view all volunteers page allows you to see a list of all volunteers, and also to add new volunteers, and edit existing ones. 

It is accessed by going to the **main menu** and then clicking **Volunteers**.

Note that a sailor can also be a volunteer - you need to add them in both roles seperately. This doesn't count as duplication.

The first grey nav allows you to get help, go back to the main menu, [add a new volunteer](add_new_volunteer_help.md) or [refresh the skills that volunteers have from an imported .csv file](refresh_skills_with_import_help.md). The second nav bar allows you to sort the list of volunteers. This is followed by the volunteers. Pressing an individual volunteer button will allow you to [view and/or edit](view_individual_volunteer_help.md) an individual volunteer.
