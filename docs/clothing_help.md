For events like Cadet Week where we provide 'merch', like clothing, it's useful to know what size/colour t-shirts and polo shirts are required.

# Getting clothing information from the registration data

The following [Skipperman field](List_and_explanation_of_skipperman_fields.md) if populated will automatically add clothing sizes for cadets:

- 'Cadet t-shirt size'


# Allocating colour groups

Note that clothing colour is not imported, instead this to be allocated. This is done in two phases:

- committee
- rest of cadets 

## Allocating committee colour groups

This should be done by the cadet commodore. Once you have their preference, click on 'Show only current cadet committee' in the clothing menu. 

If you don't see someone who is on the committee, go to the [edit committee page](cadet_committee_help.md) to add them.

In each Colour box type the relevant colour for the committee members. Traditionally the available colours have been:

- Gold
- Silver
- Blue
- Purple
- Green
- Red

Currently Skipperman is configured so it won't allocate colours unless six have been used.

Finally click Save changes.

## Allocating other colour groups

Make sure you have clicked on 'Show all cadets' if they aren't all showing. You can eithier do this manually as you did for the committee, or automatically, or a mixture. If you do it manually, then when you focus on a colour box you will see a ▼ which if you click on will give you a clickable menu of colours. Then to fill the rest up click on  'Distribute remaining colours'. This will allocate colours to get the best possible spread of ages, and to avoid putting those with similar surnames in each group (probably siblings).

# Changing a clothing size

Sometimes parents get sizes wrong. To change a size, click on the down arrow in the Size box for the relevant sailor. Delete the existing size then click on the ▼ next to the box. You should see a list of all available sizes. Select the right one. If you don't see the right size, then type it manually (but be very sure this is a valid size!).

# Getting clothing information

The table at the top of the clothing page shows how many of each size/colour to be ordered. It's worth adding a small number of spares. Once all finalised, send to whoever is ordering the merch.

There are three files you can download:

- Committee polo shirts
- All cadet sizes and colours
- Colour group allocations

## Committee polo shirts

Click on 'Show only current cadet committee' and 'Download committee polo shirts spreadsheet'. You will need to edit this as the instructions in the final row ask:

- In the 'back' column put cadets preferred nicknames (you might have to ask them); this defaults to their full first name
- In the 'right sleeve' column, if a cadet is Cadet Commodore or Cadet Vice-Commodore or Cadet Secretary then put the appropriate title

Then delete the final row, and send to whoever is ordering the merch, along with the adults polo shirt list (which you have to do manually, sorry).

## All cadet sizes and colours

Click on 'Show all cadets' if they aren't all showing, then 'Download spreadsheet of t-shirt sizes'. Give this to the cadet committee on bag packing day.

## Colour teams

Click on 'Show all cadets' if they aren't all showing, then 'Download spreadsheet of colour teams'. You will need to manually colour this, before uploading it to Skipperman [as a public file](file_management_help.md) and then sending out the link.
