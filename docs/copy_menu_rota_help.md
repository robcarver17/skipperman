# Copying

## Copying individual volunteers (on the rota page)

For a multi day event, people will often be doing the same role every day. There are two types of copying you can do to copy roles (and groups if used) across all days and avoid tiresome re-entry.

- 'Copy and fill &#8646;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and copy the same role (and group if relevant) to every day when there is currently no role allocated.
- 'Copy and overwrite &#10234;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and copy the same role (and group if relevant) to every single day irrespective of whether there is already a role allocated.

Note that the swap button moves roles 'up and down' between volunteers on the same day, whilst the copy button moves them 'left and right' across days for the same volunteer. The overwrite button is thicker, think of it has covering the existing days.

For example suppose we begin with this situation:

***
***

***
***

- For Beth we can do both kinds of copy. For example a copy and fill &#8646; from Saturday would allocate 'River crew' to Monday; whilst a copy and overwrite button &#10234; from Sunday would make all three days 'Lake crew'
- Richard has only a copy and fill option shown on Saturday &#8646; as he has no other existing roles to overwrite. Pressing this would allocate 'Coach/Topper MG' to all three days.
- Ronan has no copy buttons shown since he is only available on one day, so there is nowhere to copy to.
- Zoie has only copy and fill options shown on &#8646; for Saturday and Sunday - since both roles match there is nothing to overwrite. Pressing eithier of these would allocate 'Lake crew' to her free day on Monday.
- Jake does not have any copy and fill options shown since he has no free days to fill in. A copy and overwrite &#10234;; from Saturday or Monday would make all three days Lake helm, the same from Sunday would make all days River helm.


## Global copy (on this page)

You can also access two 'global' copy buttons by clicking on the 'Copy and/or overwrite roles from first available day' button. This will bring up a menu page.
These buttons are equivalent to pressing the &#10234; or &#8646; buttons on the *earliest day a given volunteer has a role*, but for every single volunteer. This can be quite useful for a multiday event if you want to give everyone the same role/group; just fill them in on the first day and then press the copy/fill button. Then you can fine tune people who will be on different roles for different days. Be very careful with the 'Click to copy earliest role and also overwrite all existing allocations...' button since if you have a lot of changes in allocation they will be lost. Again it's more likely to be useful when you are first putting together a rota.

### Global copy and fill 

For example if we start with the rota shown in the previous image, and then press 'Click to copy earliest role into any days when the volunteer does not have a role allocated' button, we get:

![volunteer_after_global_fill.png](/static/volunteer_after_global_fill.png)

- Beth's river crew role on the first day has been filled in for Monday; Sunday is unchanged.
- Richard's coach role on Saturday has been filled in all three days
- Ronan is unaffected as he has no free days.
- Zoie's lake role on Saturday has been filled in on Monday.
- Jake is unaffected as he has no free days.

Note that if a specific volunteer didn't have a role on Saturday, we would copy from the next day when one was set. For example if we started with this:

![volunteer_global_fill_pre_no_first_role.png](/static/volunteer_global_fill_pre_no_first_role.png)

After pressing 'Click to copy earliest role...' Beth would be a lake crew on Saturday - the earliest available role allocated (on Sunday).

### Global copy, fill and overwrite

If instead we start with the rota in the previous section, and this time press 'Click to copy ... and also overwrite existing allocations', we get this:
