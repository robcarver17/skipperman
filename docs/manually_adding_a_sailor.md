You may want to manually add sailors to an event who:

- haven't been officially registered. This is very useful for racing events, when you want to produce an accurate spotter sheet.
- who you know *will* be registered but haven't yet been
- or you know *has* been registered, but you don't want go through the hassle of [importing data from Wild Apricot](import_registration_data_help.md) 

This can be done from the [**registration editing**](registration_editing_help.md) or [**group allocation**](group_allocation_help.md) pages.

# If the sailor is already in Skipperman

Type the sailors first and last name into the relevant boxes. Then click on `Please check the details...`. A list of sailors with similar names should come up on the screen. If you can't see the sailor, then click on `Choose from all existing cadets`. You can sort the full list of sailors in a few different ways. 

Once the relevant sailor is on the screen, click on the button with their name and date of birth.

# If the sailor is new to Skipperman

 **It's really important that you don't add duplicate cadets to the Skipperman data**

But if you are sure this is a new cadet: enter their name, date of birth (making any corrections in the relevant input fields), and membership status. 

Date of birth: 

- If they are a visitor don't worry about including this, change the DOB status to 'Non member - don't need to know'. 
- If they are a member and you aren't sure of their date of birth, then choose DOB status 'I need to confirm - leave blank for now'. You can [edit the date of birth later](view_and_edit_individual_cadet_help.md). 
- If they are a member and you know their date of birth, then enter it here and set the DOB status to 'Known'

For membership status:

- if you are sure they are a paid up member, select `Member`
- if you are sure they are a non-member (visitor), select `None member`
- if you aren't sure, select `Unconfirmed member`

Membership or otherwise can be confirmed by [importing a list of club members](import_membership_list_help). 

Remember it is possible to edit the cadet details, and these can also be updated by importing a list of club members from Wild Apricot, so don't worry too much if these aren't precisely right.

Once you are confident then click on `Please check the details again for me` (if it's on screen), and then on `Yes - these details are correct - add this new cadet`.

# Effects of adding a sailor manually

Note that adding a sailor manually will set their registration status to 'Manual'. Since there is no registration information, all the registration fields will be blank. 

If the sailor is subsequently registered on Wild Apricot, and the data imported, you will get the following message:

> `There have been important changes for event registration information about cadet John Smith (2000-01-01) Member`
> `Sailor John Smith (2000-01-01) Memberis still active but status has changed from Manual to Paid: select status `

If they have been registered with different days attending, that will also be higlighted. Click on `Use new data imported from latest file` to update Skipperman.

Any other information on the registration form will be pulled in, and any volunteers included will be identified and added.

You should double check the data in SM accurately reflects what has been pulled in to the registration fields, in particular volunteers, health, food, notes, and clothing choices if relevant.
