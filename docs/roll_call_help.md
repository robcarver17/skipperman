To run a roll call report, from the **main menu** select **Reports**, and **Roll call... for event**. Then choose your event.
___

The roll call report is private to the skipper and possibly deputy skipper. It contains private health information and contact numbers.

The report can be used for the morning roll call, and in emergencies.

# Report specific parameters

- Show full names? Yes - this is a private report
- Include unallocated cadets? Yes - We still want to know where they are
- Add asterix for club boats? Yes
- Include health data - Yes - this is a private report
- Include emergency contacts - Yes

Note that health data and emergency contacts assume the relevant [skipperman fields have been populated](List_and_explanation_of_skipperman_fields.md).

Click back if you don't want to change parameters, and reset if you want to [return them to their default values](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#resetting-options).

Once you have selected the specific parameters you want, click save to return to the main [reporting option page](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#the-reporting-option-page), or [create a report with these options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#creating-a-report).

It's recommended you use the following [printing options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#print-options):

- output to .csv file
