When [allocating cadets to groups](group_allocation_help.md), boat classes and (optionally) club boats; you can also allocate sailors to sailing partners if they are in two handed boats.



For training events and cadet week (where you definitely have to register, and pay in advance), the sailing partner should be seperately registered. However, for racing events it's common to have a registration form that asks for the Helm and Crew, and doesn't require them both to register. If there is a two handed partner mentioned in the registration, and if they don't seem to be already registered, Skipperman will give you the option of adding the sailing partner to the registration list so they can be properly paired. If this is not done, then the [spotters report](spotter_sheet_report.md) won't be accurate. 

It is recommended that, to save time, you allocate a boat class, sail number, club boat (and optionally training group) to the original sailor before adding their partner. Then adding their partner will duplicate this information to the sailor you have added.

Note: A two handed partner will be added with registration status 'Manual'.

The details of the two handed partner from the form are shown. Note that we don't know that their date of birth, since that isn't a field we normally use for racing events (and in any case it would apply to the helm). 

## If this is an existing sailor

You will probably see a warning that it looks like there are existing sailors with very similar or identical names. You can click on a sailors name to register them for the event, or click on `Choose from all existing cadets` if you think they are a sailor that isn't shown. You can sort this list of sailors in various ways to find the sailor you want. You also have the option of clicking `See similar cadets only`.

Once you have chosen the sailor they will be registered to the event with the existing sailors registration details, boat class, sail number, club boat and training group copied across (where relevant).

If they are already registered you will get an error message - sailors who are already registered should be paired up by selecting them as two-handed partners from the dropdown menu in the [group allocation page](group_allocation_help.md).

## If this is a new sailor - not on Skipperman

Check you are happy with the sailors name. Don't worry about the date of birth, that can be [edited later](view_and_edit_individual_cadet_help.md).

For their membership status select eithier 'None member' (if they are a visitor), 'Unconfirmed member' (if you aren't sure), or 'Member' (if you are 100% sure they are currently a paid up member).

Membership status can be [edited](view_and_edit_individual_cadet_help.md) or automatically updated by [importing a list of members](import_membership_list_help.md).

Click on `I have double checked these details allow me to add` then on `Yes - these details are correct - add this new cadet` to add the sailor to Skipperman, and register them for this event.

## If you change your mind

Click `Cancel` and no two handed partner will be added.
