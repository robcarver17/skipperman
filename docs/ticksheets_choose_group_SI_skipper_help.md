The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress and award RYA qualifications. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

Previous step: [Initial ticksheet menu option - choosing an event](ticksheets_SI_skipper_help)

On entering the ticksheet area for a given event you will see a screen like this:

![ticksheets_group_SI.png](/static/ticksheets_group_SI.png)

It won't be exactly the same, as the groups shown might be different. 

# Download qualification progress for registered cadets

Click on the download button and you will get a spreadsheet for all the cadets at the event:

The percentages show the progress made towards getting all their ticks signed off (this accounts for half ticks). Eg if there were 16 tick items and 4 were ticked off that would be 25%, if there were 4 full ticks and 8 half ticks that would be 50%. 100% means all ticks have been completed, but no qualification awarded yet. This report is also very useful when determining how many certificates of each level to order before Cadet Week. Note that because of historic 'holes' in the data, some Cadets may show that they have eg Level 2 but not Level 1.

# Select a group

Click on a group event if you want to view, edit or print ticksheets; or award qualifications for cadets in that group.
