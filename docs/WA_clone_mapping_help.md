**To get to the clone mapping page: Main menu/Events/Select event/Import registration data/Import from WA/Check of modify WA mapping/Clone the mapping for an existing event**


Clone mapping is the easiest way to map fields for WA import. [More help on field mapping](WA_field_mapping_help)

First [create your event in Wild Apricot](WildApricothelp#creating-a-duplicated-event) by duplicating an existing event that is as similar as possible, and is already in Skipperman.

Next, from the clone mapping menu choose the event you want to clone, then click 'Finished'

**Warning: This will ovewrite any existing customised event mapping. There will be no warning or request for confirmation!!!**
