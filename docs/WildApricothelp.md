# Creating a duplicated event

When setting up a Wild Apricot event it is *strongly recommended* that you use the 'copy previous event' function and make *no* changes to the registration form.

If you do feel you have to make changes to the form, then you will need to understand how [**field mapping** works](WA_field_mapping_help.md).


# Downloading the registration file for Skipperman upload

To export registration data from WA, click on the 'Export registrants' button, select 'Export to: CSV', make sure 'Export all fields' is ticked, and click Export (it's more reliable to export a .csv file, but Skipperman can also handle .xlsx spreadsheet files if you prefer to use those).
