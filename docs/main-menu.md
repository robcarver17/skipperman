Click login, enter the username and password supplied, and you will go to the main menu:

***
***
![loggedin.png](/static/loggedin.png)
***
***

(Your screen won't look exactly like this, as the username will be different and you may not see the same menu options)

The main menu consists of the Skipperman orange banner which is always the same, including user options, and the available menu options.

### Banner with user options

The user options are in the orange block at the top of the menu.

#### Read only

Skipperman can be run in 'read only' mode. This is useful if you want to avoid accidentally making any changes, for example if you are experimenting with Skipperman. Click on 'Click for read only' to enter read only mode. If you then make any changes to any data, you will get a warning that the changes haven't been saved. Click on 'Read only: Click to change' to turn read only mode off. Read only mode can only be turned on and off from the main menu.

#### Logout

Self explanatory.

#### Change password

Self explanatory. Note that if you lose your password you will have to ask an administrator to reset it for you.

### Menu options

The menu options available are shown with the large black tiles, and will depend on the level of user that is logged in:

- Administrators can see everything
- Skippers can see everything, except the 'Administration' option
- Instructors can only see the 'Ticksheets and qualifications' option

#### Navigating inside the menu options

Menu option pages usually include one or more of the following elemnts:

- A navigation bar just under the orange box, with buttons to navigate around the menu options and perform specific tasks
- Further options, eg choosing a specific event

Never use the 'Back' button on your browser. Instead use the relevant buttons on the navigation bar:

- Main menu - return to the main menu. Only available in the first 'level' of a menu option.
- Back - return to the previous page. Only available on pages when no editing can be done.
- Cancel - return to the previous page without saving any of the most recent changes made.

The way that edits are made and saved can be slightly confusing. Where you have to type something, or enter a value in a dropdown menu, then clicking any button apart from cancel will save the edits (there is usually a specific save button, but any button will do). Where edits are made using buttons, then they are saved immediately. There is no 'undo'.
