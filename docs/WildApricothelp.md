# Creating a duplicated event

When setting up a Wild Apricot event it is *strongly recommended* that you use the 'copy previous event' function and make *no* changes to the registration form.

If you do feel you have to make changes to the form, then you will need to understand how [**field mapping** works](WA_field_mapping_help.md).

A great deal of care and thought has gone into the design of registration forms for past events. Don't make changes for the sake of it!


# Downloading the registration file for Skipperman upload

To export registration data from WA, click on the 'Export registrants' button, select 'Export to: CSV', make sure 'Export all fields' is ticked, and click Export (it's more reliable to export a .csv file, but Skipperman can also handle .xlsx spreadsheet files if you prefer to use those).

# Making changes and updates to registrations

You won't normally upload a registration file from WA to Skipperman just once. There will often be additional registrations, or last minute cancellations.

You can re-download the file from WA, and then re-upload the registration file to Skipperman (help for the latter is [here](import_registration_data_help.md#updating-an-event)). 

There will also potentially be changes to the registration information in Wild Apricot. It is strongly advised to only make changes in Wild Apricot that affect the amount that needs to be paid:

- the number of training days attended, 
- or any cancellation to an existing registration.
- or a reversal of a cancellation.

**Any other changes you make won't be reflected in Skipperman**. Instead, make the changes directly in Skipperman itself. This is to avoid the hassle of having to make multiple download and uploads of files. It also means that non Wild Apricot literate users of Skipperman can make their own updates.

You can also, if you prefer, make any of the changes above in Skipperman from the [registration page](link_required.md) to avoid the need to download and upload a new data file. If you make the changes only in Skipperman, and not in Wild Apricot, then a new invoice will not be generated. This might be preferable, if for example someone is still doing the same number of training days, but is doing Saturday only instead of Sunday. Or if someone has cancelled but with short notice and/or without a good reason, in which case you might not want to give them a refund.

# Duplicate active registrations

Skipperman assumes that each sailor has been registered once and only once at a given event. It will ignore cancelled registrations, but any duplicate registrations that haven't been cancelled can cause issues. This isn't a flaw in Skipperman - a human would get confused by multiple registrations as well! And if they are allowed to remain on the WA system, they would generate additional invoices.

To avoid this, **you should strongly discourage parents from re-registering cadets** if they have made a mistake (something they are typically going to try and do, because Wild Apricot doesn't allow you to edit a registration, with good reason). Instead:

- if the change will modify the amount to be paid (eg number of days attending), make the change yourself in Wild Apricot
- if the change won't affect payment, make the change in Skipperman itself.
