For events like Cadet Week where we provide 'merch', like clothing, it's useful to know what size/colour t-shirts and polo shirts are required.

# Getting clothing information from the registration data

The following [Skipperman fields](List_and_explanation_of_skipperman_fields.md) if populated will automatically add food preferences to cadets and volunteers:

- 'Cadet food preference' for cadets
- 'Volunteer 1 food preference' and 'Volunteer 2 food preference'

Skipperman will try and automatically categorise food preferences based on the contents of the fields; but you should still try and review them.

# Reviewing food preferences
