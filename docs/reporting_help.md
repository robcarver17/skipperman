Skipperman has some standard reports which can be found here. Some are 'public facing'; and you can share the link with parents to view them. You can also [generate QR codes for public facing reports](file_management_help.md#qr-codes-for-public-files). All reports can be downloaded, and then printed. 

These reports are sophisticated and be [configured](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md).

- [Group allocation for an event](group_allocation_report_help.md) - A public facing report which can be used to tell sailors which group they are in, in advance of the event
- [Volunteer rota for an event](volunteer_rota_report_help.md) - A public facing report to tell people what their duties are in advance of an event, or during the event
- [Spotter sheet for an event](spotter_sheet_report.md) - A report to be given to the bridge or ramp spotters to see who is on the river on a particular day
- [Roll call / health / contacts](roll_call_help.md) - Used by the skipper and deputy skipper to control who is on site and deal with emergencies

There are also the following 'simple' reports which produce raw spreadsheets without requiring configuration:

- Sailors data
  - [Achieved qualifications](qualifications_report_help.md#achieved-qualifications) - the date when a qualification was achieved. Used when working out which books need signing.
  - [Qualification and tick status](qualifications_report_help.md#qualifications-and-tick-status) at an event - useful for working out what RYA books to order and planning teaching for an event
  - [Group history and qualifications](qualifications_report_help.md#group-history-and-qualifications) - useful for planning likely group allocations 
- All event data - A giant spreadsheet with all the data for an event
- [Data dumps](data_dumps_report.md)
  - [Volunteer data](data_dumps_report.md#volunteer-data-dump) - a spreadsheet of volunteers with skills and previous events. Useful for planning.

There are also some other ways to get event data out of Skipperman, which can be accessed elsewhere:

- Raw information of volunteer information for an event - from the [Events / volunteer rota page](volunteer_rota_help.md#other-useful-functions)
- Food requirements for an event - from the [Events / food requirements page](food_help.md)
- Clothing requirements for an event with merch - from the [Events / clothing page](clothing_help.md)
- Tick sheets for instructors from the [Ticksheets and qualifications menu option](ticksheets_help.md)
