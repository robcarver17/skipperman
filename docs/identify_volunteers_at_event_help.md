When an event is being imported Skipperman will try and find the volunteers who have been mentioned in the imported registration data. If a volunteer isn't identical to one already in the data (same name), then Skipperman will give you the option of adding them as a new volunteer, or selecting an existing volunteer. You will see a screen like this:

The page tells you which sailor the volunteer was registered with. Since you can have multiple volunteers for a single sailor, we also show the 'volunteer number' (1, 2...). 

## This is not a new volunteer

If this isn't actually a new volunteer: you will probably see buttons to select an existing volunteer - Skipperman will show you the volunteers that have similar names. Click on the appropriate volunteer to identify them. If you can't see the volunteer you want, click on `See all volunteers`. You can go back to seeing just the most similar volunteers by clicking `See similar volunteers only`.

## This is a new volunteer

**It's really important that you don't add duplicate volunteers to the Skipperman data**

But if you are sure this is a new volunteer: check the first and second name are correct, then click `Add this new volunteer`. If the volunteer has errors (too similar to existing volunteer or names too short) you will have to first click `Please check these volunteer details for me`.  

## This isn't really a volunteer

If this isn't really a volunteer: click on `Skip - this isn't a volunteers name`. The most common cause of this is where the parent has accidentally put the cadets name in instead of their own. The system warns against this. Another possibility is that it is a test registration with a made up name.
