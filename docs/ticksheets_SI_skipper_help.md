The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress, and to award qualifications. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

It won't be exactly the same, as you can only see events you have or will be a senior instructor at (skippers can see everything). You can eithier click on  &#17;... to see downloadable documents, or choose an event (you can also sort the events in a different order - it defaults to most recent events first).

# Download qualification list

Click on download to see a report of qualifications awarded. This is most useful at Cadet Week to confirm which Cadets have achieved what during the week. The most recent awards will be at the top of the sheet. Note that historic qualifications prior to Skipperman are recorded with a notional date of 1st January 2024.
