To run a patrol boat rota report, from the **main menu** select **Reports**, and **Patrol boats rota for event**. Then choose your event.
___

A patrol boats rota report shows which volunteers are working on which boat. A good workflow is to publish this report about a week before the event (further in advance before Cadet Week).

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.

# Report specific parameters

The options in the report are:

- The days in the event to include in the report file. Default is to select all (which you can do by selecting the final checkbox). You may want to deslect, eg if there is nobody rota'd for the first day of Cadet Week.

Click back if you don't want to change parameters, and reset if you want to [return them to their default values](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#resetting-options).

Once you have selected the specific parameters you want, click save to return to the main [reporting option page](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#the-reporting-option-page), or [create a report with these options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#creating-a-report).

# Recommended printing options

It's recommended you use the following [printing options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#print-options):

For the normal report:

- output to csv
- output to public
- highlight first name in group - no
- put group name in header - no
- do not include group size, put group name in header, or prepend group name

See [making reports look good](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#making-the-pdf-report-look-nice) for advice on setting group arrangements and other print options.


# Configuring the teams

If you want to change the volunteer teams, this can be done through the [configuration pages](configuration_help.md#volunteer-teams).

# Sharing the report

The report can be publicly accessed once created from the web link shown on the [main reporting options page](#the-reporting-option-page). The web link will always end with the filename you are using.

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.

Report links can also be shared via QR codes, which can be created by clicking the 'Get QR code for report' button under 'Modify printing options', if a report is public.

You can also delete your report after the event from the [utilities / file management page](file_management_help.md).
