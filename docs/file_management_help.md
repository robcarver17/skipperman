___

Skipperman creates a lot of files. The file management menu allows you to manage these. There are three types of file, and clicking the expand triangle ► next to each type will allow you to see them.

► Public files  
► Private downloaded files (temporary)  
► Private uploaded files (temporary)  

# Public files

Public files are automatically created when Skipperman creates a [report](reporting_help.md), eg [a volunteer rota](volunteer_rota_report_help.md), and the user chooses to share it. Public files can be seen by anyone who has the relevant web link (that is why they aren't suitable for confidential information, and you should be careful about what reports you write to a public file). The full URL is shown for each file to make it easy to share a link to each file.



## QR codes for public files

To make it easier to share files, you can generate a QR code for any public file.

## Uploading a new public file

Sometimes it's helpful to upload a non Skipperman file, such as a notice of race or detailed organisers notes. This is helpful if you have a file you want to share but you might want to change it; it's easier to update the file on Skipperman than to keep sending round new versions. 

## Updating public files

You can update any public file with a new copy. Obviously you wouldn't normally do this with a generated file like a report, but it could be useful to do it with a file you have manually uploaded. You may need to clear your browser cache or press F5 to update a local copy of the file.

## Deleting public files

When an event has finished, it's good housekeeping to delete the relevant public files to avoid confusion. You can:

- delete all public files (but be careful!)
- Select a number of files to delete
- Delete one file at a time

# Temporary private files- uploads and downloads

Skipperman also creates temporary files when uploading and downloading data; these aren't public so only the filename and not the URL are shown. To save space, it's worth periodically deleting them. Again you can eithier delete all of them, delete one file at a time, or select multiple files to delete. You can't replace these files (except when Skipperman does so by generating a file of the same name), or geerate QR codes for them.  

# Ad hoc QR code

Sometimes you might want to generate a QR code for another web link, eg WhatsApp group. Just type in the relevant box and click generate QR code.
