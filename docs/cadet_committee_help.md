To edit the cadet committee, from the **main menu** choose **Sailors**, then **Edit Cadet Committee**.

The cadet committee are the year 12 and year 13 cadets who help organise cadet events. There are also adult members on the committee, but they are not included here. It's helpful to keep a list of committee members, not least to make sure they get polo shirts during Cadet Week. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu.md#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

# Overview

Cadets will eithier be:

- Too young to join the cadet committee
- Suggested members: eligible to apply to join the committee (from January of year 11 onwards)
- Elected to the committee during Cadet Week (July/August after year 11 at school), but not yet serving (as it's not yet November)
- Serving on the committee (Between November of year 12 and the November after they leave school)
- Temporarily or permanently suspended from the committee - 'deselected'
- A past committee member

The display screen shows the option to see suggested members, the possibility to add a new committee member, and then lists cadets in age order. Past committee members are the eldest and will be first:

# See suggested members

Click on the triangle to see a list of suggested committee members who have not yet been elected but are the correct age. This is useful when sending invitations to cadet parents to ask their children to apply.

# Add a new committee member

To add a new member, select from the dropdown list of cadets in the row including 'Prospective committee member'. Only members are shown - you may want to edit a cadet FIXME REF to correct their membership status if they aren't shown here. Then enter the date their term starts. This should be the 1st November (the nominal date of the EGM) in the year they are in year 12. Terms should last for two years. Except if you are adding a cadet very late or early, this should be filled in correctly. Then click 'Add on new member'. They will appear eithier as a current committee member or as an elected non serving member, depending on whether their term has started or not.

# Selection and deselection

Cadets can sometimes be temporarily suspended or permanently expelled from the committee. Click on the button next to an existing committee member to deselect them. A member who is temporarily suspended can be reinstated. If you make an error in adding a committee member you can also deselect them. However this isn't ideal, so don't make errors.
