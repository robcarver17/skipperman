For catered events like Cadet Week it's useful to know what peoples dietary requirements are and how much food to order.

# Getting food information from the registration data

The following [Skipperman fields](List_and_explanation_of_skipperman_fields.md) if populated will automatically add food preferences to cadets and volunteers:

- 'Cadet food preference' for cadets
- 'Volunteer 1 food preference' and 'Volunteer 2 food preference'

Skipperman will try and automatically categorise food preferences based on the contents of the fields; but you should still try and review them.

# Reviewing food preferences

From the events food page, click on ► Cadet food requirements, and then ► Volunteer food requirements.

For each cadet or volunteer at the event, you will see a series of checkboxes for common food requirements, and then an 'other' field.

## Other field is blank

If the other field is blank it means no food allergies or requirements have been specified. Move on.

## Other field contains text

If the other field contains text, this is what the volunteer or cadet has put as their food requirements. Skipperman may also have ticked boxes that it thinks match those requirments. Double check that the tick boxes match what the registering person has put in the box.

**If the food required can be accurately and completely described** by the contents of the checked boxes, then you can clear the 'Other' field.

However if it can't, for example due to an unusual allergy, then leave the relevant information in the 'other box'. Here are some examples:

- The Other box contains 'Vegan and egg white allergy'. Skipperman should have ticked the Vegan checkbox. Change the Other box to 'egg white allergy' and save.
- The Other box contains 'Vegan'. Skipperman should have ticked the Vegan checkbox. Clear the Other box entirely.
- The Other box contains 'Vegun'. Skipperman won't have ticked the Vegan checkbox, so tick it yourself and then clear the Other box.

# Getting food preference information

From the events food page, click on ► Summary. You can see how many volunteers and cadets of different ages there are on each day. You can also see how many days each volunteer is doing, in case you want to restrict free food to people who actually put in more than one shift.

The total row at the bottom shows the sum of volunteers and cadets requiring food on that day. The total over event column shows the total number of people in that category at the event.

For example, if there were just three 7 year old cadets at an event, one attending Saturday, another Sunday, and a third on both days, then the total for each day would be two; and the total for the event would be three.

# Non-volunteers getting food

There are often non-volunteers getting food, for example traditionally this has included:

- club stewards and/or warden if working during Cadet week
- club bar staff

To ensure they are included in the food numbers, add them to the event as volunteers with role 'Club staff' with all days selected. They won't appear on the volunteer rota, but they will be in the list requiring food.  If they also cover a role, eg rescue boat, you can change their role on the appropriate day.

Don't forget to add the crew off any smacks that are helping out as well, with role "River helper".
