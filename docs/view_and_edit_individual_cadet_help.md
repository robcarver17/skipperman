You can view and/ or edit individual sailors.

When you view a sailor you can see their personal attributes (name, DOB, membership status), events they have done, their qualifications, and whether they are a committee member or not. When you edit a sailor you can only change their attributes (name, DOB, membership status). Qualifications can only be awarded from the [tick sheet main menu option](ticksheets_help), by suitably authorised users. Committee status can only be changed from the [edit cadet committee screen](cadet_committee_help), which can be found when you view all cadets from the main menu.

Be careful when editing sailors. If their name or DOB doesn't match that on the club membership database, then you will have to reconcile any differences when [when a membership list is imported](import_membership_list_help). You probably don't have to edit the membership status, as this is updated automatically [when a membership list is imported](import_membership_list_help).
