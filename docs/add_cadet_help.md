To add a sailor, from the **Main menu** click **Sailors**, then **Add sailor**  
---

Sailors can be added to the Skipperman database in one of three ways:

- on the add sailor menu option which is described here
- when processing the [registrations for a training or racing event](import_registration_data_help.md) 
- if they appear as a new member when a membership list is imported [when a membership list is imported](import_membership_list_help.md)

It is *very* important that a sailor is not added twice! So the system goes to a lot of effort to make sure that you aren't duplicating an existing sailor.

On clicking `Add sailor` you will be presented with the screen above. Fill in the relevant details. 

For date of birth (DOB):

- If you don't know their date of birth, then select the status as 'I need to confirm'. You don't need to select a DOB.
- If they are not a member, eg visiting sailor, then select the status as 'Non member don't need to know'. You don't need to select a DOB.
- If you know their date of birth, then enter the date and choose 'Known' for the status.

The date of birth, and other details, can be edited later. 

- The last dropdown is for membership status, choose from the following:

- Member. Definitely a member of the club.
- Lapsed. This is a sailor that used to be a member, but is no longer.
- None member. Has never been a member. Used for visiting sailors.
- Unconfirmed member. Not sure if a member or not. Their status can be confirmed [when a membership list is imported](import_membership_list_help.md)

Click on 'Check details'. At this stage you may be presented with a series of warnings:

- The first name or surname seems too short. Don't use initials.
- The sailor seems very young (less than 8 years old at end of current school year) or very old (over 19 years old at end of current school year) for a cadet. Check their date of birth is accurate. This is no problem for junior sailors entered for junior racing events.  
- The sailor looks very similar to one or more existing sailors. Remember, we don't want to create duplicate sailors so be sure this is a different person. But you will get this warning for twins with the same birthday, as well as those with similar names.


At this stage you can make some changes, and then click `Check details again` to try and remove any warnings; cancel the adding of this cadet, or select `Yes - these details are correct` once you are happy you have everything correct. If all goes well, the system will confirm the new cadet has been added. If you have a cadet that is identical to an existing cadet (exactly the same name, and date of birth), and you have ignored the warnings, then the system will report an error and not add the sailor. Otherwise, even if there is only one letter different in their name or just one day out in the date of birth, the new sailor will be added. So once again, be very careful you aren't duplicating.
