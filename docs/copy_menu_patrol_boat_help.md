This menu will globally copy from the earliest boat allocation (and possibly role, and group allocation) to other days; with the option of overwriting.

I'd advise you to read about copying in the [volunteer rota](volunteer_rota_help#copying) before looking at copying here - they work in exactly the same way, except that for patrol boats we can copy boats, roles, or both.

For a multi day event, people will often be on the same boat and/or doing the same role every day. As for volunteers, there are two types of copying you can do to copy roles and boats across all days and avoid tiresome re-entry.

- 'Copy and fill &#8646;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and fill in any empty days with the same boat &#8646; B, role &#8646; R, or boat and role &#8646; BR.
- 'Copy and overwrite &#10234;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and copy it to every single day irrespective of whether there is already a boat and / or role allocated; again we can do this for boats &#10234; B, roles &#10234; R and both &#10234; BR.

Note that the swap button moves roles 'up and down' between volunteers on the same day, whilst the copy button moves them 'left and right' across days for the same volunteer. The overwrite button is thicker, think of it as covering over the existing days.

You can also copy, and possibly overwrite, [*designations*](patrol_boat_help.md#labelling-a-boat-with-a-designation) for different days.
