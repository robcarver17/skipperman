To add a volunter, from the **main menu** select **Volunteers**, then **Add volunteer**.

It's important to avoid duplicating volunteers, as it can get confusing. So when adding a new volunteer the system will check to see you aren't adding someone who already exists.

Once you've entered their details click on 'Check details entered'. You may then see warnings about the name apparently being too short, or as in this case a very similar existing volunteer:

You can make further changes and click 'Check details entered again', or cancel. Once you are happy with your volunteer click on 'Yes these details are correct - add this volunteer'. 

If the volunteer has EXACTLY the same name as an existing volunteer, the system will throw an error. Otherwise, it will add them, even if the name is only one letter different. So once again, be careful with duplicates.
