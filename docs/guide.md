CADETS

Skipperman keeps a master list of cadets. It's important that this is accurate, and also that are no duplicates, or it would create confusion. Hence when you import data for an event, it makes sure that you only create a new cadet if a similar one does not already exist.

Cadets can also be added manually here; this may be better than adding them when you import since you can make sure that their details are correct.

If you click on a cadet, you can view more information about each cadet and also delete them. However it is strongly advised that you don't delete cadets unless you really have to; for example if you have accidentally created a duplicate cadet when importing an event. You can't edit cadets first names, surnames or dates of birth since together those pieces of data form a unique key that identifies each cadet; it's only possible to delete them and then add them again with the new information. 


EVENTS

Training or racing events need to be created in Skipperman before you do anything else with them. The name and year of the event form a unique key, for example 'Cadet Week 2023'. You can't have events with the same name & year combination, but obviously you can have other events in the same year with different events, and it's strongly encouraged to use the same event name for different years. 

You can also create an event by cloning an existing one. That will copy across the name of the event, and also other information that defines the event, but you will have to enter new dates. Again the event key must be unique, so for example if you are running a series of training events with the same name in the same year, you will have to number them 'Feva Training Week 1' and so on. 

Once an event is created you will almost certainly want to import the Wild Apricot registration data
