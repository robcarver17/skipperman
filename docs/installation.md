# Installation - local

Once all installed you can run a local instance with (linux command line): 

```
cd skipperman
export FLASK_APP=flask_app.py
flask run
```

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on your chrome browser and you should see the skipperman home page.

# Installation - cloud

Make sure you modify the secret key in the /app/data_access/configuration/configuration.yaml file (just mash the keyboard, doesn't have to be anything special).
