To run a group allocation report, from the **main menu** select **Reports**, and **Group Allocation for Event**. Then choose your event.

A group allocation report shows which sailors are in which sailing groups. It is very useful for training weekends. A good workflow is to publish this report to parents once the groups are allocated.

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.


# Report specific parameters

The options in the report are:

- show full names of sailors? Default is no, as this report will be public
- include sailors who are not in groups? Default is no
- include asterix for club boats? Default is yes. This allows sailors to confirm that they have been allocated a club boat.

Click back if you don't want to change parameters, and reset if you want to [return them to their default values](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#resetting-options).

Once you have selected the specific parameters you want, click save to return to the main [reporting option page](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#the-reporting-option-page), or [create a report with these options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#creating-a-report).


# Recommended printing options

It's recommended you use the following default [printing options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#print-options):

- output to pdf
- output to public
- A3 landscape (since the report probably won't be printed this is moot, but landscape is better for busy reports)
- put group name in header - yes
- including size of group in header - yes
- do not highlight first value or prepend group name

See [making reports look good](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#making-the-pdf-report-look-nice) for advice on setting group arrangements and other print options.

# Sharing the report

The report can be publicly accessed once created from the web link shown on the [main reporting options page](#the-reporting-option-page). The web link will always end with the filename you are using.

It's better to share a link rather than a file, as the former will be automatically updated.

Report links can also be shared via QR codes, which can be created by clicking the 'Get QR code for report' button under 'Modify printing options', if a report is public.

You can also delete your report after the event from the [utilities / file management page](file_management_help.md).
