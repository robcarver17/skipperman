The patrol boat rota page is used to allocate volunteers to patrol boats. Only volunteers who have been added to the event can be allocated - if you want to add a volunteer, you will need the main [volunteer rota page](volunteer_rota_help#add-a-volunteer). Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.

# Overview

After an event has been imported, you will be presented with a screen like this:

# Boats

## Adding a boat

The first thing we need to do is add a boat. Select a boat from the drop down and click add a boat. If the boat you want isn't listed, you will need to add it via the configuration pages. You can add as many boats as you like.

![boat_added.png](/static/boat_added.png)

## Removing a boat from the rota

Click on 'remove boat from rota' to remove a boat entirely. 

FIXME - there is currently a bug where you need to press the button several times.

# Allocating volunteers 

## Allocating a volunteer to a boat

Select a volunteer from the dropdown menu, and then click save changes. Volunteers are listed in order, with the ones most likely to be on a boat listed at the top. Note that those with PB2 qualifications are marked, and you can also see their current volunteer role if any in the dropdown. You can add several volunteers at a time, before clicking save. Once a volunteer is added to a boat on a given day, they can't be added to another boat.

![volunteers_added_to_boats.png](/static/volunteers_added_to_boats.png)

Once you have added one volunteer to a boat and pressed save, you have the option of adding more by selecting them from the dropdown on the boat, and then clicking save. The volunteers above all existing roles in the volunteer rota, but it's also possible to add someone who doesn't, so let's do that:

![volunteer_added_to_boat_second.png](/static/volunteer_added_to_boat_second.png)

Note: Skipperman doesn't know about boat capacity, so it will allow you to add as many people to a boat as you like. It also won't currently check to see you have a PB2 driver on each boat - this is down to you.

## Changing roles of volunteers on boats

We can change the allocated role of a volunteer, or add a role to a volunteer who doesn't have, by selecting the role from the dropdown and hitting save:

![boat_changed_role.png](/static/boat_changed_role.png)

Note that we can't change the group of a DI or coach who is on a boat, so it's best to use this function only for safety boat drivers and crew, and do all other role changes in the volunteer [volunteer rota page](volunteer_rota_help#changing-roles-and-groups). Remember by convention a 'helm' is just someone who has the relevant PB2 certificate so there can be more than one helm on a boat.


## Removing a volunteer from a boat

To remove a volunteer from a boat, click on the &#174; symbol button. Note this won't remove from the volunter rota or change their role, just from the boat.


# Summary

Once you have some volunteers on boats, you can see a summary of how many people are on each boat by clicking &#17;Summary. This is a useful check to make sure you have the right number of helm/crew.

# Qualifications table

Click on &#17;Qualifications to see the editable qualifications table:

![boat_quali_table.png](/static/boat_quali_table.png)

For every person on a boat, that shows you whether they have PB2 or not. You can add or remove PB2 qualifications by changing the tickbox and pressing Save. Don't assume someone has PB2 - always check the official spreadsheet via the link.

# Copying

I'd advise you to read about copying in the [volunteer rota](volunteer_rota_help#copying) before looking at copying here - they work in exactly the same way, except that for patrol boats we can copy boats, roles, or both.

For a multi day event, people will often be on the same boat and/or doing the same role every day. As for volunteers, there are two types of copying you can do to copy roles and boats across all days and avoid tiresome re-entry.

- 'Copy and fill &#8646;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and fill in any empty days with the same boat &#8646; B, role &#8646; R, or boat and role &#8646; BR.
- 'Copy and overwrite &#10234;' - this will copy from the relevant day where the button is located, and copy it to every single day irrespective of whether there is already a boat and / or role allocated; again we can do this for boats &#10234; B, roles &#10234; R and both &#10234; BR.

Note that the swap button moves roles 'up and down' between volunteers on the same day, whilst the copy button moves them 'left and right' across days for the same volunteer. The overwrite button is thicker, think of it has covering the existing days.

As with the volunteer rota you can also copy, or copy and overwrite, across all volunteers using the buttons in the navigation bar for boats, and also for boats and roles.

# Swapping

I'd advise you to read about swapping in the [volunteer rota](volunteer_rota_help#swapping) before looking at swapping here, they work in exactly the same way except that you can swap boats, or boats and roles.

The swap button &#8693; allows you to swap round two volunteers. Note that a swap button moves roles 'up and down' between volunteers on the same day, whilst a copy moves them 'left and right' across days for the same volunteer. Just as for copying, we can swap boats using &#8693 B or boats and roles with &#8693 BR (we can't swap just roles - that can only be done on the [volunteer rota page](volunteer_rota_help#swaps)). It's also not possible to swap boats and roles if you are a DI, coach or AI; swapping boats and roles is usually used for moving people between lake and river boats. Consider this starting point:

![boat_pre_swap.png](/static/boat_pre_swap.png)

- Simon, Beth and Jake can all swap boats and roles.
- Richard is an instructor so we can only swap boats with him.

## Swap boats

Initially let's just swap boats; if we click on Simon's Saturday  &#8693 B swap boat button we enter 'swap mode;:

![pressed_swap_boat_button.png](/static/pressed_swap_boat_button.png)

In 'Swap mode' we can only do one of two things, swap a volunteer with someone else, or cancel the swap. All the other buttons and functions are temporarily unavailable. Clicking on the button for the volunteer we wanted to swap (Simon) would obviously cancel the swap. Note we can't swap boats with Beth as we already on the same boat. If we click on Jake's 'Swap boats with me', we get:

![after_swapping_boats_button.png](/static/after_swapping_boats_button.png)

Jake and Simon now both have the wrong role; so this is most useful if you are moving within the river or lake safety fleet where the role doesn't change.

## Swap boats and roles

Instead of pressing swap boats, what would have happened if we had pressed Simon's Saturday  &#8693 BR swap boats and roles button?

![pressed_swap_boats_and_roles_button.png](/static/pressed_swap_boats_and_roles_button.png)

- Beth is on the same boat, if we press swap role then Simon will become the crew and Beth the helm.
- Richard is a coach, so we can't swap roles, only swap boats
- Jake is on a different boat, so we would swap both boats and roles.

Let's click on Jake as it's the most interesting:

![after_swapping_boats_and_roles.png](/static%2Fafter_swapping_boats_and_roles.png)

You can see how this is useful for moving safety crew between the lake and river.

Remember by convention a 'helm' is just someone who has the relevant PB2 certificate so there can be more than one helm on a boat.
