There are three reports available under 'Sailors data'. 

# Achieved qualifications

No configuration is required, just click to generate the report.

This is a list of cadets, qualifications, date awarded and who awarded. The default order is from most recent to oldest awarded. Awarded by is the current name of the volunteer associated with the user who was logged in to Skipperman when the award was made. This could only be an admin user, or a Senior instructor.  

This report can also be accessed from the Instructors menu.

# Qualifications and tick status

Select the relevant event to generate the report.

This is a list of cadets, sorted into sailing groups, showing their progress against tick sheets in each of the possible qualifications. A percentage shows the proportion of ticks completed at the relevant level. 'Qualified' indicates a qualification has been awarded. 100% without a qualification means all the ticks have been awarded, but no qualification has been given yet. This can happen during the season when ticks are awarded but qualifications not awarded until Cadet Week. It may also be an issue with data imported from the spreadsheet that was used before Skipperman to log ticks.

This report can also be accessed from the Instructors menu, once an event has been selected.

# Group history and qualifications

This includes the 'achieved qualifications information' and then adds additional columns showing the sailing group a given sailor was allocated to for each event.
