# Notes to full field list

## Usage

- High: Core field in all events, should not be omitted
- Depends: Core field in certain events
- Display: Shown to users to help them make decisions, but not vital
- Infer: Used to infer registration information, but not vital
- Report: Printed in reports
- None: Not currently used, but reserved for potential future usage


## Cadet and two handed partner names

Use eithier:
- Helm first name, Helm surname, Crew first name, Crew surname. **You must include all of these fields**. Recommended for racing only events where we don't need to register every sailor individually.
- OR Cadet first name, Cadet surname, Two handed partner. **You must include all of these fields**. Recommended as has fewer fields.


## Formats

### Text

Just any old text

### Contains X

If contains the phrase 'X', then we make an inference from it. Eg if Boat class field contains the phrase 'club boat', then Skipperman will assume the sailor needs a club booat (but this can be modified).

### Similar to ...

Similar to data in skipperman. Eg if 'boat class' contains 'Feva', then this can be used to automatically infer the information that the sailor is sailing an RS Feva.  


### Limited text

No restrictions in Skipperman itself but would usually contain one of a limited number of values, eg T-shirt size.


### Date and date/time

Dates: eg 11/08/2023 09:00:00
Dates and times: eg 11/08/2012 


### Day selection

Eithier:

- Contains 'all days': All days that event is running
- Contains 'both days': For two day events, both days the event is running
- Contains one or more of Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun: The days that are selected, out of Monday, Tuesday... Sunday. eg 'Mon, Tuesday, Frid' will resolve to Monday, Tuesday, Friday

If missing, will default to all days.

It's recommended that you don't use the weekend fields for simplicity; in practice both types of fields (all days and weekend fields) are parsed in exactly the same way.

### Status selection

asdf

# Field lists recommended for different event types

## Single class training weekend, eg Feva training
