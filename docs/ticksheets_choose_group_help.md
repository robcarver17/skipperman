The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress. Make sure you are not in [read only](main-menu#read-only) mode if you want to make changes - use read only mode for experimenting.


On entering the ticksheet area for a given event you will see a screen like this:

![ticksheets_group.png](/static/ticksheets_group.png)

It won't be exactly the same, as it will depend on what groups you are teaching at that event.

Click on a group event if you want to view, edit or print ticksheets for cadets in that group.
