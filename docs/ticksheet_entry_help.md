The ticksheets and qualifications menu allows you give 'ticks' recording progress. 
To access it, from the **main menu** choose **Ticksheets and qualifications**, then the event, then choose the group, and finally the qualification.

On entering the area you will see something like this:

# Printing ticksheets

The first thing you will probably want to do is print your ticksheet to excel (this actually downloads it, and from there you can print it). You will probably want to tidy up the formatting a bit, possibly abbreviate medical notes, or import into your own format. Note: The * against a cadets name in the printed ticksheet means they have booked a club boat. Remember that health information is confidential and should only be retained for as long as required. Paper ticksheets must be returned to the cadet skipper or destroyed. Downloaded files should be deleted after the event.

# Entering ticks

You can also input your own ticks. There are two edit modes, ‘checkbox’ and ‘dropdown’. In checkbox mode you can only award full or no ticks. In dropdown mode you specify tick values using a dropdown menu; this allows you to aware Not Applicable (NA) or half ticks as well as the binary choice of full tick or no tick. A half-tick means you have introduced a given topic, but the cadet has not yet demonstrated it.

## Checkbox tick entry

In checkbox mode you can only award full ticks, or reset an item to no ticks. You can also give a cadet all their ticks by clicking on their name ('row apply'), or give all your cadets a tick for a specific item by clicking on the relevant item ('column apply'). If nearly all your cadets got a specific item, then it’s quicker to award it to all of them and then remove it from the cadet who missed out.

Note that if a half tick or N/A tick is awarded, then this can’t be edited to a full or no tick in checkbox mode - as is the case for David and ropework. You will need to go to dropdown mode. 

Also, you can’t edit ticks if a cadet has already been awarded a given level. If a cadet already has this RYA level, then it will be shown in brackets after their name. Note that only senior instructors can award a given qualification; this won’t happen automatically once a cadet has all their ticks. 

When you are done just save your changes (pressing a button to award all ticks to a cadet or to all cadets for a specific item will also save changes). If you don’t want to save, press cancel and that will abandon everything you have done since you last pressed a button (save button, or a row/column apply).


## Dropdown tick entry

In dropdown mode you specify tick values using a dropdown menu; this allows you to award Not Applicable (NA) or half ticks as well as the binary choice of full tick or no tick. Clicking on a cadet name or item will award a full tick for all items for a given cadet ('row apply'), or all ticks for that item over all cadets ('column apply'). The other buttons next to the cadet and item name do the same, but for half ticks, NA ticks, and no ticks (which will remove all the ticks for a given cadet or item).

Also, you can’t edit ticks if a cadet has already been awarded a given level. If a cadet already has this RYA level, then it will be shown in brackets after their name. Note that only senior instructors can award a given qualification; this won’t happen automatically once a cadet has all their ticks. 

When you are done just save your changes (pressing a button to award all ticks to a cadet or to all cadets for a specific item will also save changes). If you don’t want to save, press cancel and that will abandon everything you have done since you last saved or pressed a row/column apply button


# Skipperman on mobile - individual cadet editing

It’s quite hard to see a big ticksheet on a phone. This isn’t so bad if you are just applying ticks to all cadets at the same time, since you can scroll left and right across the column heading buttons that do this. But it’s hard to know when you are looking at a cadet who is halfway down a big list which ticks you are settting. So there is the facility to select a single cadet. You can’t do this whilst you are editing, only before you start. Let’s say I only want to do the ticks for David. I click on his name:

![ticksheet_entry4.png](/static/ticksheet_entry4.png)

All the other cadets have gone. I can now proceed with editing in the normal way, for example by clicking on `Edit using checkboxes`

![ticksheet_entry5.png](/static/ticksheet_entry5.png)

I can easily scroll left and right to see and edit all of his ticks. Notice that the buttons at the top of the column that apply ticks to all cadets are now gone – with only one cadet these aren’t needed. 

Once done, I click on save, and I am back to viewing just one cadet. And if I am done with David I can now click on `Show all cadets` to see everyone again. And I can then select a new cadet to edit.
