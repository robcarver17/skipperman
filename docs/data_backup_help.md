To access data backup, from the **main menu** select **utilities**, then **data backup,upload and restore**.

Data can be backed up in two different ways on Skipperman.

- A data snapshot
- A full backup

# Data snapshot

Snapshots are stored locally on the Skipperman server, and are a good way to periodically save what you have done in case you do something stupid (since there is no undo function). To make a snapshot you can eithier click 'Snapshot data' on the main menu page, or click the 'Write a snapshot of the data now' button on the backup data utilities menu option. To restore a snapshot, click on the 'Restore data from data snapshot' button on the backup data menu. 

Once a snapshot has been restored you can't go back to how the data was before the snapshot was taken (unless you already have a snapshot or full backup), so please bear this in mind.

Only the last 10 snapshots are kept.

# Full backup

A full backup creates a .zip file containing all the data which is then downloaded to your local machine. This can then be uploaded from the local machine. This is useful for testing and code development, and to take a copy of the data should something happen to the remote server.
