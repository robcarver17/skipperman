To run a spotter sheet report, from the **main menu** select **Reports**, and **Spotter sheet for event**. Then choose your event.
___

A spotter sheet is used by the bridge to ensure all cadets leave and return safely to shore, and to help setup sailwave for racing events. It should be sent to the race officer at least a week before the event.

Spotter sheets also include any club boats allocated to instructors, although their sail numbers will not be known in advance.

# Report specific parameters

The following parameters are recommended:

- display full names? Yes 
- add extra columns to check boats in and out? Yes
- Exclusions and inclusions: default is to exclude lake sailors, and include other groups. Note MG sailors are always included. We include unallocated sailors, since at a pure racing event we don't allocate training groups.

Click back if you don't want to change parameters, and reset if you want to [return them to their default values](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#resetting-options).

Once you have selected the specific parameters you want, click save to return to the main [reporting option page](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#the-reporting-option-page), or [create a report with these options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#creating-a-report).

# Recommended printing options

It's recommended you use the following [printing options](general_report_config_and_printing_help.md#print-options):

- output to csv file
- private (public is okay: although you will not share this widely as it contains the full names of sailors, if you share the report as a link with the race officer they will see updates automatically)
- put group name as header
- include size of group
- include row number
- drop group name from columns
