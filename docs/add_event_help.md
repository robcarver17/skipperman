On clicking add event you will be asked fpr:

- The name of the event. If you click the down arrow, it will give you some names of events that have been used already
- The start date of the event
- The length of the event in days, eg 2 days for a weekend, 6 days for cadet week, 3 days for a three day race series...

The event name is the name of the event without the year, eg 'Cadet Week'. You can't have the same event with the same year; but you can have the same event in different years - indeed this is encouraged. So if there is more than one event in a particular year, add a number suffix eg 'Feva training 2'.

Click on 'Check details' when you have input the required information. At this stage you may be presented with a series of warnings:

- The event started in the past (normally you wouldn't do this unless you are 'backfilling' data for an historical event)
- The name of the event seems quite short
- The event is more than a week in length  
- The event looks very similar to one or more existing events. This will be normal if you've created an event with the same name and a different year

At this stage you can make some changes, and then click 'check details again' to try and remove any warnings; cancel the adding of this event, or select 'Yes - these details are correct' once you are happy you have everything correct. If all goes well, the system will confirm the new event has been added. If you have an event that is identical to an existing event (exactly the same name, and event year), and you have ignored the warnings, then the system will report an error and not add the event. Otherwise, even if there is only one letter different in their name, the new event will be added. So once again, be very careful you aren't duplicating.
