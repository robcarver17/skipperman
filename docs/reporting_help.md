Skipperman has some standard reports which can be found here. Some are 'public facing'; and you can share the link with parents to view them. You can also [generate QR codes for public facing reports](file_management_help.md#qr-codes-for-public-files). All reports can be downloaded, and then printed. Most are highly configurable.
