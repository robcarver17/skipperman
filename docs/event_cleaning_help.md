To clean event data from the **main menu** choose **Utilities** and **Delete sensitive data**. 

Skipperman stores some sensitive; confidential and personal information. Some of this needs to be kept indefinitely as it is essential to the working of the system. But some event specific data is no longer needed once an event has finished

Select the event you want to remove data from. Only events that have already happened are shown to avoid accidentally deleting data from an active event. As the warning says, you will not be asked for confirmation and this can't be undone without restoring an [old backup or snapshot](data_backup_help.md).

This will remove *all* information stored in the registration form, of which the following are sensitive-

- Reported medical conditions
- Parents phone and email contacts


#  Potentially sensitive personal information that is kept permanently

- Cadet names, dates of birth
- Volunteer names and skills (eg PB2, DI)
- Cadet qualifications and progress towards those qualifications (‘ticksheets’)
