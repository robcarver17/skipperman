A qualification ('stage') consists of substages and tick items. A substage is just a logical grouping of ticks. You shouldn't need to edit qualification details unless you have set up a new qualification, or to make minor changes to names.

It isn't possible to delete substages or ticks; or this would corrupt the qualification records of existing cadets. If the syllabus of an existing qualification changes substantially, then you should probably create a new qualification and rename the old (eg 'RYA1' becomes 'RYA1 pre 2024' and 'RYA1' is the new qualification).

To change the name of a substage, first delete the existing name in the entry box:

Now click on the down arrow. A list of existing substages will be presented. Note the LB stages are for the lake badge, which uniquely has one tick in each stage. Select an existing substage. Alternatively, if the substage you want doesn't exist then type it into the box. Click 'save changes' when you are done.

If you want to revert to the original name after deleting it, you can click 'Cancel' (which always abandons any changes and returns you to the previous page), copy and paste the name from the right hand column ('Tick items in sub-stage: Rigging etc'), or hit CTRL-Z (undo change).

## Add a new substage

If you want to add a new substage, scroll to the bottom of the list:

Again, if you click on the down arrow you can see a list of suggested substages to choose one, or enter a completely new name.

# Tick items

The tick items for a given substage appear on the right of the screen.

To edit a particular tick item in a substage, just change the text and click save. There is no autocomplete option.

To add a new tick item for a substage, enter it's name under 'New tick item for sub-stage ...' and click 'Add'.
