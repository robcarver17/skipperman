For each volunteer attending an event, Skipperman will check:

- that the volunteer availability is consistent across registrations (eg if they are associated with more than one cadet)
- that the information the volunteer has put down about their duty preference is consistent over multiple registrations
- that the volunteer is attending on days when none of their sailors is not attending (note we don't check to see if the reverse is true - eg a volunteer not coming for all the days their sailor is attending)
