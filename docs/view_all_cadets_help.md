The view all sailors page allows you to see a list of all sailors registered (which will include member cadets, ex-cadets, junior sailors, and visitors), and also to add new sailors, edit existing ones, and look at or edit the cadet committee.

The first grey nav bar allows you to go back, find help, [add cadets](add_cadet_help), [import a list of club members](import_membership_list_help) from a .csv file, or [edit the cadet committee](cadet_committee_help). The second nav bar allows you to sort the list of sailors by different attributes.

This is followed by a list of sailors. Each has their first name, surname, date of birth and membership status. Please bear in mind your obligations to keep this information private. The following membership status are available:

- Member
- Lapsed. This is a sailor that used to be a member,
- None member. Has never been a member.
- Unconfirmed member. Not sure if a member or not; typically used when a new sailor is registered for an event but we are unsure if they are a member or not.  

See the [help page for importing a membership list](import_membership_list_help) for more details about membership status. Clicking on any sailor will allow you to [view them in detail, and edit them](view_and_edit_individual_cadet_help).
