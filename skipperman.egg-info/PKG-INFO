        ## Installation
        
        This package isn't hosted on pip. So to get the code the easiest way is to use git:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/robcarver17/skipperman.git
        #
        # then one of (linux):
        #
        python3 setup.py install # normal
        python3 setup.py install --user # avoids use of sudo
        ```
        
        There is a more complete installation guide [here](docs/installation.md)
